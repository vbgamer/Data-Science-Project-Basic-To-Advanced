# **Report on Iris Dataset Classification using Machine Learning**

## **1. Introduction**  
The **Iris dataset** is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning and classification tasks. It consists of **150 instances** of iris flowers, categorized into **three species**:  
1. **Setosa**  
2. **Versicolor**  
3. **Virginica**  

Each flower sample is described using **four numerical features**:  
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**

## **2. Dataset Overview**  
The dataset contains **150 rows** and **5 columns** (4 feature columns + 1 target variable). There are **no missing values** in the dataset, and the target variable has **three unique species labels**. Each class contains **50 samples**, making it a balanced dataset.  

**Key Observations:**  
- **Setosa** species is distinctly different from the other two species.  
- **Versicolor** and **Virginica** have overlapping feature distributions, making classification more challenging.  
- **Petal length and petal width** are the most significant features for distinguishing species.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
EDA helps in understanding the relationships between features and their importance in classification.  

- **Feature Distribution Analysis:** A pairplot reveals that Setosa is easily distinguishable, while Versicolor and Virginica have some overlap in feature values.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** A heatmap of feature correlations shows that petal length and petal width have a strong positive correlation, indicating their importance in classification.

## **4. Classification Approach**  
For this classification task, we use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm**. KNN is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its **k nearest neighbors**.  

### **4.1 Data Splitting**  
To train and evaluate the model, the dataset is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** subsets.  

### **4.2 Model Training & Prediction**  
The KNN classifier is trained on the **training dataset**, and predictions are made on the **test dataset**. The accuracy and performance of the model are then evaluated.

## **5. Performance Evaluation**  
### **5.1 Confusion Matrix**  
The confusion matrix is used to visualize the model's classification performance. It compares the **actual species labels** with the **predicted species labels**, showing correct and incorrect classifications for each class.  

A confusion matrix for this classification task typically looks like this:

| **Actual \ Predicted** | **Setosa** | **Versicolor** | **Virginica** |
|------------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Setosa**            | 10 ✅       | 0 ❌          | 0 ❌        |
| **Versicolor**        | 0 ❌        | 9 ✅          | 1 ❌        |
| **Virginica**         | 0 ❌        | 1 ❌          | 9 ✅        |

- The **diagonal values** represent correct classifications.  
- The **off-diagonal values** indicate misclassifications.  
- Since the dataset is well-structured, the confusion matrix usually has **high values on the diagonal**, meaning a high classification accuracy.  

### **5.2 Accuracy Score**  
The accuracy of the KNN classifier on the **test dataset** is typically around **95-98%**, indicating that the model performs well.  

### **5.3 Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**  
A classification report provides additional performance metrics:  
- **Precision:** Measures how many predicted labels were actually correct.  
- **Recall:** Measures how many actual instances were correctly classified.  
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.  

Since Setosa is well-separated, its precision and recall are usually **100%**. However, Versicolor and Virginica may have slight misclassifications.

## **6. Insights & Conclusion**  
### **Key Takeaways:**  
1. **Setosa is easily classified** because it has distinct feature values.  
2. **Versicolor and Virginica** have some feature overlap, leading to occasional misclassifications.  
3. **Petal length and petal width** are the most important features for classification.  
4. **KNN achieves high accuracy (~95-98%)**, making it a reliable model for this dataset.
