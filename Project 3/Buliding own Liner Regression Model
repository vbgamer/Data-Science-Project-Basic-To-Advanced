Detailed Report on Linear Regression

1. Introduction to Regression

Regression is a fundamental concept in machine learning and statistics used for predicting continuous outcomes. It establishes a relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a mathematical model to the data.

Types of Regression

Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous target variable based on a linear relationship with independent variables.

Multiple Linear Regression: Extends simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables.

Polynomial Regression: Captures non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial terms.

Logistic Regression: Used for classification problems, despite its name.

2. Understanding Linear Regression

Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X) using the equation:



Where:

Y = Predicted value

m = Slope (coefficient)

X = Independent variable

c = Intercept

For multiple independent variables, the equation extends to:



where  are the regression coefficients.

3. Implementing Linear Regression

3.1 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Approach

OLS is a mathematical method to find the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.

Steps for OLS Method:

Calculate mean of X and Y.

Compute slope  using:


Compute intercept :


Predict values using .

3.2 Gradient Descent Approach

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization technique used for large datasets.

Steps for Gradient Descent:

Initialize  and  to 0.

Compute predictions: .

Calculate loss function (Mean Squared Error - MSE).

Compute gradients:



Update  and :



Repeat for a given number of epochs.

4. Application: Insurance Charges Dataset

4.1 Dataset Overview

The Insurance Charges Dataset consists of:

Numerical Features: age, bmi, children

Categorical Features: sex, smoker, region

Target Variable: charges (insurance cost)

4.2 Data Preprocessing

Convert categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Scale numerical features for better model performance.

4.3 Training the Model

We use Scikit-learn's LinearRegression module to fit the model on the preprocessed data. The model learns the relationship between features and insurance charges.

4.4 Model Evaluation

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared error between actual and predicted values.

R² Score: Indicates goodness of fit (1 = perfect, 0 = no relation).

5. Results & Visualization

Model Coefficients: Shows the impact of each feature on insurance cost.

Scatter Plot: Compares actual vs predicted charges.

Residual Analysis: Examines prediction errors.

The results indicate that features like smoking status and BMI significantly influence insurance charges.

6. Conclusion

✔ Linear Regression effectively models the relationship between insurance charges and personal attributes.
✔ The OLS method provides a direct analytical solution, while Gradient Descent is useful for large datasets.
✔ The trained model shows a good fit with an acceptable MSE and R² score.
✔ Further improvements could include Polynomial Regression for non-linear relationships and Feature Engineering to improve model performance.
